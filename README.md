### Overview
Welcome to Cardano Wyoming!

This group is for anyone interested in the Cardano blockchain, ADA, and other Cardano-related technologies. All skill levels are welcome. We started this group to help others increase their understanding of the Cardano blockchain and to provide a safe space for the Wyoming Cardano community to meet, "face-to-face."

We will make it a point to discuss Wyoming's role in the future of Cardano, including: the Wyoming Advanced Blockchain Lab (WABL), ongoing blockchain-friendly legislation, and exciting industry news from around the state. Whether you are an expert on Cardano, or just now getting your feet wet, please join us at our next event!

#### Meetings
Recurring Round Tables take place on the **last Tuesday of every month, @ 6pm MST** via zoom.
